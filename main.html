	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to analyze how efficient <br>
	    an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run<br>
	    as a function of the size of the input. It provides<br>
	    a high-level understanding of how the runtime of<br>
	    an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
	</p>
	 <p >
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of working<br>
	    storage an algorithm needs. It quantifies the total space<br>
	    required by the algorithm as a function of the size of the input data.<br>
		 <br>
		O(n): Linear space - the space required grows linearly with the input size.
